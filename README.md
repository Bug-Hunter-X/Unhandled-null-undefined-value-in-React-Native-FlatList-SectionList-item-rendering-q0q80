# React Native FlatList/SectionList Null/Undefined Item Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common, yet sometimes elusive, bug in React Native when rendering items in FlatList or SectionList components. The issue arises when trying to render an item that contains a `null` or `undefined` value in its properties. This is particularly problematic when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data might not be fully loaded yet.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that causes the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle the null/undefined values gracefully.

## Reproducing the Bug

Clone this repository and run the `bug.js` example.  You'll likely encounter errors related to accessing properties of `null` or `undefined` objects. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to effectively handle this issue by implementing checks for `null` and `undefined` values before accessing their properties. This prevents runtime errors and allows for smoother and more robust rendering.  The solution uses optional chaining and nullish coalescing to provide a concise way to handle missing data.
